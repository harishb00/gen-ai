# Gen AI

This is a project to document my learning journey in Gen AI. Below is a rough outline of the topics I will be covering.

* LLM (Generation Model, Representation Model)
* Context window
* Making sense of nomen clatures? like 7B, 8B, 
* Transformers
* Quantized Models
* Tokenization

* Tokens & Embeddings
* Prompt Engineering
* Vector Databases
* RAGs
* Agents
* Training LLMs (embedding models, generation)
* Fine-tuning LLMs (SFT, QLoRA)

* Text Classification
* Text Clustering
* Semantic Search
* RAG
* Agents
* Multimodel LLMs
